# 🚀 Feature Request: Michael's Interactive Persona ("The Whisper")

**Status**: READY FOR DEVELOPMENT
**Priority**: High (User Experience Differentiator)
**Assignee**: Next Session AI

## 1. The Vision (产品愿景)
We want to transform `soeasyhub.com` from a static tool site into a "Humanized Service". 
Users should feel like **Michael** (the multi-expert persona) is sitting right next to them, offering advice at critical moments.

**The Feature**: 
When a user hovers over specific "high-friction" or "high-emotion" elements (like Upload buttons, Purchase buttons, or confusing inputs), a collaborative "Whisper Bubble" appears with a persona-specific tip.

## 2. Technical Implementation (技术方案)

### A. The "Smart Tooltip" Engine
Do NOT hardcode specific HTML for every tooltip. Instead, build a universal listener.

**HTML Usage (How to use it in templates):**
```html
<!-- Lawyer Persona (Blue Theme) -->
<button class="btn-upload" 
    data-michael-persona="lawyer" 
    data-michael-tip="Your files stay on your device. I never see them.">
    Upload PDF
</button>

<!-- Psychologist Persona (Green/Warm Theme) -->
<div class="loading-spinner" 
    data-michael-persona="psychologist" 
    data-michael-tip="Breathe in... Breathe out... formatting normally takes 3 seconds.">
</div>
```

**JavaScript Logic (pseudo-code):**
1. Listen for `mouseenter` on any element with `[data-michael-tip]`.
2. Dynamically create a DOM element (`.michael-whisper-bubble`).
3. Inject the correct **Avatar Image** based on `data-michael-persona`.
4. Inject the text from `data-michael-tip`.
5. Position it near the mouse/element with a bouncy CSS animation.

## 3. Asset Generation (美术资产 - 这里的Prompt直接拿去跑)

You need to generate 3 distinct avatars. They must share the **Same Art Style** (e.g., "Minimalist 3D Avatar" or "Flat Vector Style").

**Core Character**: Male, 35-40 years old, glasses, friendly but professional Asian/International look.

### 🎨 Prompts for Image Generation:

**1. The Lawyer (File: `img/michael_lawyer.png`)**
> **Prompt**: "A friendly 3D cartoon avatar of a professional man named Michael. He is wearing a sharp dark blue suit and tie. He has glasses and looks trustworthy and protective. Solid soft circular background (light blue). High quality, Pixar style icon."

**2. The Psychologist (File: `img/michael_psych.png`)**
> **Prompt**: "A friendly 3D cartoon avatar of the same character Michael. He is wearing a cozy beige cardigan sweater. He is holding a steaming cup of tea. He has a warm, empathetic smile. Solid soft circular background (warm sage green). High quality, Pixar style icon."

**3. The Teacher (File: `img/michael_teacher.png`)**
> **Prompt**: "A friendly 3D cartoon avatar of the same character Michael. He is wearing a crisp white shirt with rolled-up sleeves. He is pointing a finger up as if explaining an idea. Enthusiastic expression. Solid soft circular background (energetic orange). High quality, Pixar style icon."

**Note to AI**: The user loves "Ritual" and "Detail". Make the animation smooth and the bubbles look premium (glassmorphism or clean shadows).
