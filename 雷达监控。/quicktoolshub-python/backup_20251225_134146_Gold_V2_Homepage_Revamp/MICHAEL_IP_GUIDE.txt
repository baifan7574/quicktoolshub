# Michael's IP & Persona Guide (PROJECT BIBLE)

This document defines the unique "Personal IP" strategy for SoEasyHub. All future content must adhere to these guidelines to distinguish us from generic tool sites.

## 1. The Persona: "Michael"
Michael is not just a developer; he is a polymath with a diverse professional background. We leverage these specific credentials to add authority and "human touch" to different tools.

### Michael's Credentials (Use these contextually):
- **Lawyer (律师)**: Use for tools involving data privacy, contracts, copyright, or compliance (e.g., PDF tools, Watermark tools).
- **Psychologist (心理咨询师)**: Use for tools involving user experience, color, focus, or stress reduction (e.g., Pomodoro, Breathing apps, UI/UX tools).
- **Teacher (老师)**: Use for educational tools, tutorials, or explaining complex concepts simply (e.g., Math tools, Format converters).
- **Labor Relations Coordinator (劳动关系协调员)**: Use for productivity tools, office efficiency, or HR-related utilities.
- **Certified E-commerce Specialist (中国电子商务师)**: Use for business tools, SEO calculators, or marketing utilities.
- **Saxophonist (萨克斯等级证书)**: Use for audio tools, metronomes, or creative arts tools.
- **Mandarin Proficiency (普通话等级证书)**: Use for text-to-speech, language learning, or text processing tools.

## 2. The "Three-Piece" Development Standard
Every new tool MUST consist of these three distinct components without exception:

### Part A: The Logic (Privacy First)
- **Rule**: Client-side processing (JavaScript) whenever possible.
- **Why**: "Michael" values privacy (Lawyer persona) and security.

### Part B: The UI (Clean & Responsive)
- **Style**: Dual-pane (Input/Output), "Clear" button, copy-to-clipboard functionality.
- **Visuals**: Clean typography (Playfair Display for headers), distinct "Call to Action" buttons.

### Part C: The "IP-Infused" SEO Content (The Differentiator)
This is where we kill the competition. It must include:
1.  **The Expert Quote**: A specific, high-level insight signed by **" — Michael"**.
2.  **Real-World Case Studies**: "Scenario 1", "Scenario 2" demonstrating actual professional pain points.
3.  **Human Tone**: Avoid robotic text. Speak to the user's anxiety (Psychologist) or legal safety (Lawyer).

## 3. Example Usage
*Bad*: "This tool formats JSON."
*Good*: "As a developer, messy code causes anxiety. As a **Psychologist**, Michael knows that visual clutter increases cognitive load. Use this JSON Formatter to calm your mind and code."

*Bad*: "Compress PDF here."
*Good*: "Sending uncompressed contracts looks unprofessional. As a **Lawyer**, Michael advises keeping files sleek and accessible. Ensure your client receives the document instantly without hitting email size limits."
