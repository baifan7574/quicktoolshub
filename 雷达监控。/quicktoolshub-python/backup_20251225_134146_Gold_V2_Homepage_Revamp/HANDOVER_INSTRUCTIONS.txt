# 🚀 HANDOVER INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION
# Date: 2025-12-24
# Status: RESTORED & STABLE (Features Active)

## 📌 Context
The project `soeasyhub.com` is a Flask-based tool website. We encountered a critical regression where the site was broken, but it has now been fully restored to a stable state with **all premium features active**.

## ✅ Current System State
1. **Core Functionality**: All tools (Image, PDF, Text, etc.) are working.
2. **"Wish Wall"**: Live at `/tools/wish-wall`. Accessibility via Navbar link (injected via JS).
3. **"Quick Alert"**: Floating red button (!) on all tool detail pages for instant bug reporting.
4. **Backend**: 
   - `tools_new.py`: Contains the `wish-wall` partial logic and hardcoded tool definitions.
   - `routes/api.py`: Contains the `/api/feedback` endpoint for Supabase integration.
5. **Frontend**:
   - `detail_new.html`: Contains the UI for all tools + Quick Alert script + Wish Wall link injection.
   - `templates/pages/wish_wall.html`: Template for the Wish Wall page.

## 📂 Critical Files (Do NOT Delete or Overwrite without backup)
- `tools_new.py` (Source of Truth for Tool Logic)
- `detail_new.html` (Source of Truth for Frontend)
- `routes/api.py` (API Endpoints, including feedback)
- `deploy_stable.py` (Use this script to deploy. It handles the 3-file update: tools, blog, detail).

## ⚠️ Important Rules for Next Agent
1. **Deployment**: ALWAYS use `python deploy_stable.py` to push changes. It uploads `tools_new.py`, `blog_final.py`, and `templates/tools/detail.html`.
   - *Note*: You must manually ensure `routes/api.py` is uploaded if you change it, as `deploy_stable.py` largely focuses on the main 3 files. (Ideally, update the deploy script to include `routes/api.py` if needed in the future).
2. **Three-File Rule**: Logic is concentrated to enable easy portability.
3. **Supabase**: The `user_feedback` table is active and receiving data.
